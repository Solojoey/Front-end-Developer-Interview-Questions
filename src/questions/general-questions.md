* What did you learn yesterday/this week?I've learned that getting GitHub are two separate applications I've learned about AI I've learned about government and certain things is going on I brought quite a few things and I continue on every day
* What excites or interests you about coding? Everything that I used to read on my phone apps everything everyone uses starts with coating and through coding I can achieve everything I've ever wanted in my life and it's just a process of learning and how to do itI've come to realize that it's easy and I meant to do this.
* What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?well I'm working on creating a couple of businesses writing code script shopping it it's still a process it's never going to be sold as I've come to learn everything is always evolving so you trying to evolve and understand what does what
* When building a new web site or maintaining one, can you explain some techniques you have used to increase performance?well I use Google drive to backup and save a lot of things I use my chrome browser in my bookmarks and my star stuff Nathan that helps further my knowledge in research and education

* What actions have you personally taken on recent projects to increase maintainability of your code?I've been researching and learning what I can do to contribute more.
* Talk about your preferred development environment.
* Which version control systems are you familiar with?I'm working on understanding HTML,Java,but python 3 is a goal of mine to learn as well as Google's new algorithmic I can't remember the name of it but they have a program where they use pictures and everything to code and it's this amazing projects and I was trying to learn more about that but down the road.
* Can you describe your workflow when you create a web page?I think probly like I'd add read me and explain what I added or changerd

* Can you describe the difference between progressive enhancement and graceful degradationhttps://goo.gl/search/graceful+degradation
What is graceful degradation? - Definition from WhatIs.com Graceful degradation is the ability of a computer, machine, electronic system or network to maintain limited functionality even when a large portion of it has been destroyed or rendered inoperative. The purpose of graceful degradation is to prevent catastrophic failure.
?Progressive enhancement is a strategy for web design that emphasizes core webpage content first. This strategy then progressively adds more nuanced and technically rigorous layers of presentation and features on top of the content as the end-user's browser/internet connection allow. The proposed benefits of this strategy are that it allows everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page, using any browser or Internet connection, while also providing an enhanced version of the page to those with more advanced browser software or greater bandwidth. How would you optimize a website's assets/resources?Graceful degradation is the ability of a computer, machine, electronic system or network to maintain limited functionality even when a large portion of it has been destroyed or rendered inoperative. The purpose of graceful degradation is to prevent catastrophic failure. * How many resources will a browser download from a given domain at a time?
* What are the exceptions?not sure
* Name 3 ways to decrease page load (perceived or actual load time). I'm not sure
* If you jumped on a project and they used tabs and you used spaces, what would you do?let them know I use spaces
* Describe how you would create a simple slideshow page.Well I would use Google slides for pictures and charts and add dogs for changing adding text maybe adding to pictures websites
* If you could master one technology this year, what would it be? Google/GitHub they are the best company I've ever had the pleasure of working with and them actually recognizing my professionalism and skills and show me the politeness respect that I haven't really experienced other places besides very few in a handful
* Explain the importance of standards and standards bodies.standards are the basis for criteria of making a decision standard bodies our companyhttp://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/standards-bodies.html
What are standards bodies? definition and meaning ...) is an organization whose primary activities are developing, coordinating, promulgating, revising, amending, reissuing, interpreting, or otherwise producing technical standards[1] that are intended to address the needs of a group of affected adopters.basically in my comprehension of the knowledge that I have acquired and uncovering these past few weeks months whatever they are basically responsible for the survival and Future of all humanity just to put it in short terms laughing  loud

* What is what is flash of unstyled content? How do you avoid FOUC?basically it's a flash of the original content before a separate script comes in and corrects it https://petrey.co/2017/05/the-most-effective-way-to-avoid-the-fouc/
The Most Effective Way to Avoid the FOUC â€¢ Stephen PetreyFirst, add a class to your html document

<html class="no-js">...
Then put this little guy at the very-bottom of your scripts file:

(function(H){H.className=H.className.replace(/\bno-js\b/,'js')})(document.documentElement)
And finally add this to your CSS, render content invisible until it loads:

visibility: hidden;
 opacity: 0;
}

.js {
 visibility: visible;
 opacity: 1;
}

* Explain what ARIA and screenreaders are, and how to make a website accessible.Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.
 screen reader is a form of assistive technology (AT)[1] which is essential to people who are blind,[2] as well as useful to people who are visually impaired,[2] illiterate, or have a learning disability.[3] Screen readers are software applications that attempt to convey what people with normal eyesight see on a display to their users via non-visual means, like text-to-speech,[4] sound icons,[5] or a Braille device.[2] They do this by applying a wide variety of techniques that include for example interacting with dedicated accessibility APIs, using various operating system features (like inter-process communication and querying user interface properties) and employing hooking techniques.[6]t supplements HTML so that interactions and widgets commonly used in applications can be passed to assistive technologies when there is not otherwise a mechanism. For example, ARIA enables accessible navigation landmarks in HTML4, JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and more.  Explain some of the pros and cons for CSS animations versus JavaScript animations.
* What does CORS stand for and what issue does it address?Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system, consisting of transmitting HTTP headers, that determines whether browsers block frontend JavaScript code from accessing responses for cross-origin requests. How did you handle a disagreement with your boss or your collaborator?
* What resources do you use to learn about the latest in front end development and design? GitHub and Google and voice commands and Wikipedia anyting YouTube I used MIT for some knowledge there some email is a kind of decoded and found some websites I was running from Turner name of the company I like to research and read up on just about everything technical and educational
